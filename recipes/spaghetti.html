    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: 1 pound (450g) of dried spaghetti noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong>: Two cans of crushed tomatoes and one can of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>: Two cloves of garlic, minced, and one small onion, finely chopped.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs and Seasonings</strong>: Fresh basil leaves, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes for a hint of heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: To sauté the garlic and onion and add richness to the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A teaspoon of white sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan Cheese</strong>: Grated Parmesan cheese for garnish and extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce</strong>: In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and chopped onion, sautéing until softened and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Tomatoes</strong>: Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, stirring to combine. Season with salt, black pepper, dried oregano, and a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeten and Simmer</strong>: Sprinkle in a teaspoon of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Allow the sauce to simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti</strong>: In a separate pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain the cooked pasta, reserving a small amount of pasta water.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce</strong>: Add the cooked spaghetti to the tomato sauce, tossing gently to coat each strand. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish with Fresh Basil</strong>: Tear fresh basil leaves and sprinkle them over the spaghetti, gently tossing to incorporate.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Garnish</strong>: Divide the spaghetti among plates or a large serving platter. Grate Parmesan cheese over the top and garnish with additional fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong>: Serve immediately, savoring each forkful of this comforting classic. Pair with a crisp green salad and crusty bread for a complete meal.</li>
    </ol>
